#Project Title: NYC ABNB Classification

#Description: ##This project observes NYC ABNB listings and predicts if a given listing will have over 165 availabilities in a given year.

#Features and Target Variables: ##calculated_host_listsings_count, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, latitude, longitude, room_type, price,
minimum_nights, number_of_reviews, last_review, reviews_per_month. Availability_365.

#Data Used:

#Tools Used: ##Numpy, Pandas, Matploblib, SKLearn, Tableau, graphviz, mglearn

#Possible impacts of your project:

The model predicts which listings will have over 165 days of availabilities in a given year. These listings are probably not as valuable to the listsings
that have less than 165 days of availabilities. Turns out that hosts with multiple listings are not likely to be providers of an "AIRBNB experience", thus 
Airbnb should focus their marketing spends on these hosts rather than expanding their listings via acquiring hotels.
